# movesets-bot

A friend asked what it would take to make a bot that could pull up random Pokemon movesets that were
"legal", meaning that instead of pulling from every single move that existed, you could only pull
moves from the list that the Pokemon in question could be able to learn. Pulling again from
[veekun/pokedex][], this is an attempt at doing just that.
